    previously mentioned modal dialog

@using Forloop.HtmlHelpers
@using (Html.BeginScriptContext())
{
    // This JS file sets the modal data-backdrop to static, data-toggle to modal
    Html.AddScriptFile("~/Scripts/Views/Modal_CreateMealTypeDialog.js");
}
@{
    // Pull in layout html for the modal dialog & insert the html here
    Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_LayoutModal_General.cshtml";

    ViewBag.ModalTitle = "Create";  // This text will show up on the Header of the modal dialog
    ViewBag.ModalId = "CreateMealTypeModalDialog";  // This is the ID of the modal dialog
}
